                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Brock Buczkowski. I'm currently a Sophomore majoring in Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman.</p>
                <p>
                    This website is a portfolio project that I was assigned in my Intro to Web Programming Class.
                    The goal of this project was to show us how to set up and publish our own websites. The Resume page 
                    also contains a version of my current resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My free time is usually spent hanging out with my friends or playing video games. Sometimes, I 
                    do both at the same time. My passion for video games was what pushed me towards Software Engineering
                    as a major. While there are people who think that video games are bad for children, they helped shape
                    me into the person that I am today.
